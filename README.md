## Hi there 👋, I am Aditya Singh

I am an aspiring AI/ML researcher dedicated to leveraging data science and machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems. Having progressed from foundational coursework to implementing advanced models, my journey has focused on building end-to-end solutions—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to deploying sophisticated methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Multimodal Fusion. I am committed to contributing to AI-driven solutions for social good, particularly in the domain of climate and sustainability.

## 🔬 Research Interests & Focus Areas
- Applied AI/ML: Developing and integrating robust Machine Learning models for challenging, high-impact datasets.
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Utilizing structural data (graphs/networks) to enhance deep learning representations.
- AI for Good: Applying AI/ML to climate, sustainability, and scientific discovery.
- Data-Driven Research: Uncovering latent structures and policy-relevant insights through unsupervised learning

## 📌 Featured Projects:
I have organized my work into two main threads that demonstrate my ability to handle complex data, build robust models, and derive actionable insights.

#### Multimodal Learning for Scientific Discovery
  - [Enhancing Topic Coherence in NLP Literature using Combined Semantic and Graph Embeddings](https://github.com/aditya27singh/SBERT_GCN_topic_discovery_NLP)
    * Objective: Overcame the limitations of purely semantic clustering by integrating citation network structure.
    * Methodology:  Developed a multimodal fusion strategy combining:
      ** Semantic Embeddings from Sentence-BERT (SBERT) on paper abstracts.
      ** Structural Embeddings from a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on a citation graph of 1,000 papers.
    * Results: The combined representation achieved a  Silhouette Score than either SBERT-only or GCN-only models, resulting in more topically coherent and interpretable clusters of Transformer research.

##### ML and Policy Insights in Climate and Sustainability
  
- 🌍 [Climate & Sustainability Data Analysis](https://github.com/aditya27singh/Climate_sustainability_analysis)
  Exploratory analysis of climate datasets, preprocessing, insights, and visualization — preparing for ML integration.
- [Integrating Machine Learning into Existing Project ](https://github.com/aditya27singh/Climate_Data_Insights_Using_ML)
  Enhanced my first project by adding ML models for clustering and anomaly detection.
- [Research Paper Reproduction & Extension](https://github.com/aditya27singh/ML_Reproduction_and_Extension)
  Reproduced and extended a CO₂ emissions paper using OWID data, various clustering models, PCA vs Non-PCA, temporal analysis, and policy insights.
