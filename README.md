## Hi there 👋, I am Aditya Singh

I am an aspiring AI/ML researcher dedicated to leveraging data science and machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems. Having progressed from foundational coursework to implementing advanced models, my journey has focused on building end-to-end solutions—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to deploying sophisticated methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Multimodal Fusion. I am committed to contributing to AI-driven solutions that benefit society, particularly in the domains of climate and sustainability.

## 🔬 Research Interests & Focus Areas
- Applied AI/ML: Developing and integrating robust Machine Learning models for challenging, high-impact datasets.
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Utilizing structural data (graphs/networks) to enhance deep learning representations.
- AI for Good: Applying AI/ML to climate, sustainability, and scientific discovery.
- Data-Driven Research: Uncovering latent structures and policy-relevant insights through unsupervised learning

## 📌 Featured Projects:
I have organized my work into two main threads that demonstrate my ability to handle complex data, build robust models, and derive actionable insights.

### Multimodal Learning for Scientific Discovery
  - [Enhancing Topic Coherence in NLP Literature using Combined Semantic and Graph Embeddings](https://github.com/aditya27singh/SBERT_GCN_topic_discovery_NLP)
    * Objective: Overcame the limitations of purely semantic clustering by integrating citation network structure.
    * Methodology:  Developed a multimodal fusion strategy combining:
      * Semantic Embeddings from Sentence-BERT (SBERT) on paper abstracts.
      * Structural Embeddings from a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on a citation graph of 1,000 papers.
    * Results: Integrating citation-based structural embeddings with SBERT significantly improved clustering performance compared to semantic embeddings alone. Although the GCN-only representation achieved the highest separability, the combined approach provided a balanced semantic–structural representation that improved topic coherence.
    * Streamlit demo (deployed):

### ML and Policy Insights in Climate and Sustainability
  - 🌍 [Climate & Sustainability Data Analysis](https://github.com/aditya27singh/Climate_sustainability_analysis)
    Performed extensive cleaning, feature engineering (growth rates, intensity), and visualization on multi-source datasets (OWID, World Bank) to create a robust foundation for ML.
  - [Integrating Machine Learning into Existing Project ](https://github.com/aditya27singh/Climate_Data_Insights_Using_ML)
    Enhanced my first project by applying K-Means Clustering and Isolation Forest to identify three distinct global economic archetypes based on CO₂ emissions and GDP dynamics (e.g., high-income, declining-emission vs. mid-industrializing, rising-emission economies).
  - [Research Paper Reproduction & Extension](https://github.com/aditya27singh/ML_Reproduction_and_Extension)
    * [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17215995.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17215995)
    * Successfully reproduced and significantly extended a key CO₂ emissions paper, comparing multiple unsupervised learning models (KMeans, GMM, Hierarchical Clustering), assessing PCA impact, performing temporal analysis (1990–2020), and generating policy-relevant recommendations based on cluster dynamics. A report is present on Zenodo.
