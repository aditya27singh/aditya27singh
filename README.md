## Hi there 👋, I am Aditya Singh

I am an undergraduate B.Tech student passionate about **AI/ML research** and its applications in solving real-world problems. Right now, I am exploring projects around climate and sustainability, and my goal is to contribute to **AI-driven solutions for real-world challenges**
I am still early in my research journey, but I am working step by step - learning the foundations, building projects, and preparing to move deeper into data-driven research and AI for good.

## 🔬 Research and Interests:
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Data-Driven Decision Making
- Applications of AI in real-world problems

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools:
- Python
- Libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Mathematics for ML
- Machine Learning

## 📌 Featured Projects:
- 🌍 [Climate & Sustainability Data Analysis](https://github.com/aditya27singh/Climate_sustainability_analysis)
  Exploratory analysis of climate datasets, preprocessing, insights, and visualization — preparing for ML integration.
- [Integrating Machine Learning into Existing Project ](https://github.com/aditya27singh/Climate_Data_Insights_Using_ML)
  Enhanced my first project by adding ML models for clustering and anomaly detection.
- [Research Paper Reproduction & Extension](https://github.com/aditya27singh/ML_Reproduction_and_Extension)
  Reproduced and extended a CO₂ emissions paper using OWID data, various clustering models, PCA vs Non-PCA, temporal analysis, and policy insights.
